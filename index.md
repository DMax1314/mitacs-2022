Project tittle: Online optimization of a dial-and-ride problem with the integral primal simplex

Project Location Province: Québec

With the increase in ridesourcing services as Uber, Didi or Lyft, the needs to optimize the rider and driver matching is essential to operate an efficient system. This dial-and-ride problem has already received a wide attention from the academic world in its offline version. In its dynamic form, the problem is becoming more and more popular. These ridesourcing services need indeed to solve dynamic problems and compute in real-time the routes of their drivers. We propose to use the strengths of the integral primal simplexe (compute a new integer solution from a previous one) to expand the current routes with the new incoming requests. The proposed algorithm will be tested on the Trip Record Data of the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission.
